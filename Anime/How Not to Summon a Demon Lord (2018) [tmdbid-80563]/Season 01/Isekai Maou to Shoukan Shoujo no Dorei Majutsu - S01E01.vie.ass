The closest town is the Border City, Faltra. It is a point used for\Nsummoning and conducting the Enslavement Ritual. This tower is often the first destination of Summoners.\N\NConducting the ritual between the four pillars at the top of the tower allows a random Summon to\Nbe called to the altar at their center. Conducting the summoning ritual requires players to be above\Na certain level, spend a suitable amount of magic stones, and use specific catalysts. Magic stones can be obtained by spending real money, but catalysts can only be obtained as rewards for completing quests and events.\N\NWhen conducting a standard summoning ritual, a random Summon that is a lower level\Nthan the player character will appear on the center altar. Success is guaranteed.\N\NIn addition, one can attempt a rare summon. If a rare summon fails, nothing is summoned and only magic stones\Nare consumed. Rare summons have a very low success rate, but one can gain extremely high-level Summons this way.\NBut since high-level Summons have high abilities that consume great amounts of MP, Summoners often\Ncannot make use of them until they advance in level. For this reason, few players ever attempt a rare summon.

Rare summons have a very low success rate, but one can gain extremely high-level Summons this way.\NBut since high-level Summons have high abilities that consume great amounts of MP, Summoners often\Ncannot make use of them until they advance in level.

This tower is often the first destination of Summoners.\N\NConducting the ritual between the four pillars at the top of the tower allows a random Summon to\Nbe called to the altar at their center. Conducting the summoning ritual requires players to be above\Na certain level, spend a suitable amount of magic stones, and use specific catalysts. Magic stones can be obtained by spending real money, but catalysts can only be obtained as rewards for completing quests and events.\N\NWhen conducting a standard summoning ritual, a random Summon that is a lower level\Nthan the player character will appear on the center altar. Success is guaranteed.\N\NIn addition, one can attempt a rare summon. If a rare summon fails, nothing is summoned and only magic stones\Nare consumed. Rare summons have a very low success rate, but one can gain extremely high-level Summons this way.\NBut since high-level Summons have high abilities that consume great amounts of MP, Summoners often\Ncannot make use of them until they advance in level. For this reason, few players ever attempt a rare summon.
